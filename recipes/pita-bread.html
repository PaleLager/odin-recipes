         <p>This homemade pita bread recipe comes from my friend Molly Yeh&rsquo;s Short Stack Yogurt cookbook.
            It&rsquo;s
            been on my list to try since the book was first released two years ago, but for one reason or another, I
            never
            made it until this spring. When I finally did, what Jack and I thought would be a fun, one-time cooking
            project
            turned into a full-on pita bread obsession. We started putting extra yogurt on the grocery list just so we
            could
            make it!</p>
         <p>If you&rsquo;re thinking, “Wait. Yogurt? In pita bread?”, you&rsquo;re not crazy. It&rsquo;s not a typical
            pita
            bread recipe ingredient, but Molly&rsquo;s book is all about yogurt how it&rsquo;s a versatile, flavorful
            ingredient that happens to be good for you too. She uses it in a huge range of recipes from soup to cookies
            to
            ranch dressing and mac and cheese.</p>

         <h2>Ingredients</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>220g warm water</li>
            <li>1 package of active dry yeast/li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of sugar</li>
            <li>470g of bread flour</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoon sea salt</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>3/4 cup whole milk Greek yogurt</li>
         </ul>

         <h2>Steps</h2>
         <ol>
            <li>In a medium bowl, combine the water, yeast, and 1 teaspoon of sugar. Let the mixture sit until
               it&rsquo;s
               foamy on top, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, combine the flour, salt, and
               remaining
               tablespoon sugar. Add the yeast mixture, oil, and yogurt, and mix to combine. Knead the dough, either in
               the
               stand mixer or on a clean work surface, adding more flour if needed, until it&rsquo;s soft and slightly
               sticky,
               7 to 10 minutes. Transfer the dough to an oiled bowl, cover with a towel or plastic wrap, and let rise
               until
               it&rsquo;s doubled in size, about 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 500°F and line two baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Turn the dough out onto a clean work surface and divide it into 12 equal balls. Cover and let rise an
               additional 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Roll the balls out into circles that are 1/4 to 1/2-inch thick. Place them onto the baking sheets an
               inch
               apart, then bake, one sheet at a time, until they&rsquo;re puffy and lightly browned on top. Begin
               checking
               at
               5 minutes. We bake them for about 8 minutes, rotating the pan after the 5 minute mark if one side of the
               sheet
               is puffing up more than the other. Transfer the pitas to a wire rack to cool.</li>

   <div class="note">
      <h3>Note:</h3>
      <p>These freeze really well. Molly recommends pulling them out of the oven just before they&rsquo;re brown if
         you
         plan to store and reheat them. To thaw, pop them in the toaster - they&rsquo;ll brown up a bit as they
         toast.
