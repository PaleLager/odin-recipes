         <p>New Yorkers pride themselves on three things: bagels, cheesecake, and, of course, their pizza.
            This homemade New York Style Pizza recipe captures the essence of NYC pizza without having to travel to
            the
            east
            coast!</p>
         <p>This is not like a Neapolitan pizza—it has a thin, crisp crust, which is essential to a pizza if you ask
            anyone
            from the city. And the best part is, the dough is so easy to make! It’s made with super simple
            ingredients,
            too: I
            use bread flour (but you can use all-purpose flour as well), some sugar, some sea salt, instant yeast,
            and
            just
            some water and oil!</p>
         <p>New York Style Pizza is defined by its crust. Unlike Neapolitan crust, it is thin, crisp, and less
            bubbly.
            The
            crust at the end should be a bit thicker, but the middle should be thin and soft enough to fold. The
            dough
            is
            topped with just a thin layer of sauce, and dry, shredded mozzarella is used instead of fresh, which
            gives
            you
            a
            more even melt and those lovely browned spots of cheese.</p>

         <h2>Steps</h2>
         <h3>The day before:</h3>

         <div class="list">
            <ol>
               <li>In a bowl of an electric mixer add the flour, sugar, salt, and yeast.</li>
               <li>In a separate jug add the warm water and oil.</li>
               <li>Turn the machine o to medium speed and add the wet ingredients into the dry. Just add enough
                  liquid
                  for
                  the
                  dough to form a ball. (The dough can be made by hand if you knead it for roughly 8-10 minutes on
                  your
                  work
                  surface).</li>
               <li>When the dough is ready, divide the dough into three balls and place each in a container with a
                  sealable
                  lid.
                  Place in refrigerator and allow to rise at least one day, and up to 4 days. The dough can also be
                  frozen
                  at
                  this stage.</li>
            </ol>
         </div>


         <h3>The next day:</h3>

         <div class="list">
            <ol>
               <li>At least two hours before baking, remove dough from the refrigerator and allow it to sit at room
                  temperature
                  to take the chill off it.</li>
               <li>Preheat the oven to 500°F (250°C) and place in a pizza stone or tray if using. Turn a dough ball
                  out
                  onto a
                  lightly floured surface. Gently stretch the dough by draping over your knuckles into a 12-14 inch
                  circle
                  about
                  1/4-inch thick. Slide the pizza base onto a flat baking tray lined with parchment (see video above)
               </li>
               <li>Spread pizza sauce evenly over the surface of the crust, almost to the edge. Sprinkle cheese over
                  sauce
                  followed by any of your favorite pizza toppings.</li>
               <li>Slide pizza onto baking stone and bake for roughly 12 - 15 minutes or until bubbly and golden
                  brown.
                  Transfer
                  to cutting board, slice, and serve immediately.</li>
            </ol>
